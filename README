<ins>What is SoopFw?</ins>

SoopFw is a PHP-Framework which has the goal to reduce development time while 
not losing performance.
It is designed to work as fast as possible.

The main idea was created in 2009 to build up a lightwight, powerfull framework 
which does not hold the developer to much in the framework structure.

The original code was refactored in Jan, 2012.
It grows in some kind, also we reduced code which was not needed anymore and
now it is not only a framework.
Personaly if i must descripe SoopFw i would tell it is a thing in the middle of
a framework and a content management system.
It has the power to work as a content management system (some modules are
development to have a modular content on the page) but it can also be used as
a little backend framework to do other things.
